            If we only took positive steps, it would be 1+2+3+4=10>9.
            Now, at any point(say i), if you would have taken a step backward, your sum would have been 2*i less than the sum you have if i was in positive direction.

            So in case sum-2i=target, it means we have to take one negative step
            This means (sum-target)=2i i.e. (sum-target is even).

            Hence you go on to the next move until the condition (sum-target==2*i) is true
            This is why you check (sum-target)%2!=0 at every iteration of the loop.
